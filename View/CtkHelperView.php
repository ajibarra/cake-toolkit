 * View, the V in the MVC triad. View interacts with Helpers and view variables passed
 * in from the controller to render the results of the controller action.  Often this is HTML,
 * but can also take the form of JSON, XML, PDF's or streaming files.
 *
 * CakePHP uses a two-step-view pattern.  This means that the view content is rendered first,
 * and then inserted into the selected layout.  This also means you can pass data from the view to the
 * layout using `$this->set()`
